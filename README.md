# BCG X Data Science Project - Churn Reduction for PowerCo

My key findings and suggestions for further data augmentation.


## Project Overview

Welcome to the BCG X Data Science project focused on reducing customer churn for our client, PowerCo, a major utilities company. This README.md provides a brief summary of my analysis and approach.
## Client Background

PowerCo has been experiencing declining profits, primarily due to significant customer churn within their Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) customer segment. BCG X has been engaged to help PowerCo address this critical issue by leveraging advanced analytics initiatives.
## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to drive churn reduction within PowerCo's SME customer base. As a BCG X Data Analyst, my mission is to use data-driven insights and strategies to help PowerCo retain and engage their SME customers effectively.
## Task 1: Collection of Data & Formulating the Hypothesis of Price-Driven Churn for PowerCo

1) Problem Formulation:

Hypothesis: Churn in the SME segment is influenced by price changes.
Data Science Problem: To identify which customers are more likely to churn at their current price and assess the potential impact of offering a 20% discount on retaining at-risk customers.

2) Data Collection:
Collect historical data on customer behavior, pricing changes, and churn events.
Request data on customer demographics, contract details, and usage patterns.
## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

1) I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset provided by the client, which includes historical customer data, historical pricing data, and a churn indicator. The goal was to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset.

2) I attempted to verify the hypothesis that price sensitivity is correlated with churn. Price sensitivity was defined as the extent to which pricing changes impact a customer's likelihood to churn.
